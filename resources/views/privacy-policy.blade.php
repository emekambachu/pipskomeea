                            We value our privacy immensely. This is the reason we have developed a privacy policy in such way that we can serve our needs and so we do not collect or use any of your personal information, more than the amount we need to complete our stated objectives and other related purposes. Presented below is an outline of our privacy policy and standards.<br><br>

                            In order to complete our objectives and related purposes, we may require our clients to provide us with direct identifiers such as name, email address and phone number. During the time of collecting personal information, we make it a point to identify the main purpose for which we are asking the information. If we put the information to any other use, we will take the consent from the specified individual and even the law bodies, if required. We do not collect and store Credit/Debit card information of our members. We do not collect genetic, biometric or data concerning health<br><br>

                            We will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute Personal Data to third parties except as provided in this Privacy Policy. For every transfer we need to make, we will make sure that we have the consent of the specified individual. We retain our right to transfer information when this is necessary to comply with legal obligations that apply to us, in which case we do not need consent, but we will inform the specified individual.<br><br>

                            To ensure the security and confidentiality of Personal Data that we collect online, we use data networks protected, by industry standard firewall and password protection. In the course of handling Personal Data, we take measures reasonably designed to protect that information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and against other unlawful forms of processing. We make a point to keep personal information safe and it will not be accessed by unauthorized users.<br><br>
                            We retain the information only up until the task is not accomplished. Once our purpose is accomplished, we make sure we do not retain the information much longer. We may retain Personal Data if we have to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.<br><br>

                            Whenever we process Personal Data, we take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is kept accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected.  If you wish to contact us regarding the use of personal information or to object in whole or in part to the processing, you can email us at Pipskomeconsultant@gmail.com. If you have provided consent, you may wish to withdraw it at any time. You may request to access your Personal Data is processed by us, to ask for correction, erasure or to request portability, where applicable.<br><br>

                            We are willing to disclose our policies and practices related to the management of personal information to all our customers who ask for clarification.<br><br>
