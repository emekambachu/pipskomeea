                            <strong>1. Trading is a risky affair</strong><br>
                            Forex is an extremely risky affair and is not meant to be visualized as retirement funds. So, it is most suitable for customers who Understand the risks and are willing to undertake it. Financially capable of standing losses that can even exceed the deposited amount. Hence, a proper understanding of the risk is necessary prior to trading in the forex.<br><br>

                            <strong>2. High leverage and low margin can culminate in a quick loss</strong><br>
                            Owing to price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency contracts, the combination of high leverage and low margin can lead to significant losses. The initial margin can be small when you compare it with the value of the foreign currency and so the transactions can be leveraged. Customers need to maintain the minimum margin requirements for the open position at all times. It is the duty of the customer to keep an eye and monitor his net outstanding balance. If the minimum requirement is not maintained, we hold the right to liquidate all open positions. Similarly, leverages too can lead to high gains as well as losses.<br><br>

                            <strong>3. Risk-reducing orders and strategies</strong><br>

If your purchased options expire worthlessly, you will suffer a total loss of your investment and it shall also comprise the purchase of the option as well as the transaction costs too.
